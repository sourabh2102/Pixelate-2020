# pixelete-2020
this code is for pixelate event in technex(2020) in IIT(BHU). It is an image processing event. this code leads our team to gain second position.
We made an image processing based autonomous robot.
We designed an autonomous robot that used feed from an overhead camera to apply Image Processing to place boxes at a specific blocks marked with same shape and color that present under the box. Implemented Djkstra algorithm to effectively move the robot in the arena while placing the blocks at their correct location.
